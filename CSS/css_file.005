        <p>There are total 8 planets in our solar system.</p>
        The solar system is a vast collection of celestial bodies orbiting the Sun. 
        The solar system consists of the Sun, eight planets, their moons, and countless
        asteroids and comets. The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from
        a giant cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. Beyond Neptune lies the
        Kuiper Belt, home to icy objects and dwarf planets like Pluto. The solar system
        extends far beyond that into the Oort Cloud, a vast region of distant comets and
        frozen bodies that marks its outer boundary.
